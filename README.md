### What is Swift?

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc.

For all Apple product, the operating system behind it is written in swift.

Development of Swift started in July 2010 by **Chris Lattner**, with the eventual collaboration of many other programmers at Apple. 
Swift took language ideas from Objective-C.

Swift is a *strongly-typed* language.

In swift, when declaration of variable or constant is made, it automatically picks up the data type
This is referred to as _type inference_.

We have 6 types of data:

 - String 
 - Int 
 - Double 
 - Float
 - Character 
 - Bool

This is an example declaration of a variable in Swift

```swift
var someVariable: String = "Afolabi Ayanfe"
```
